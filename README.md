## Notes

  Throughout the project the main challenge I faced were around familiarizing myself with the android studio IDE. Learning the capabilities
and formatting of android studio was different than the IDE's I had used previously such as VS, VSC, Eclipse, or IntelliJ as android development
includes a built-in UI system that I hadn't used before as well as the separate activity classes and transitioning between them like classes.
After playing around with the IDE and working through the first few walkthroughs, I became much more comfortable with using the IDE.
